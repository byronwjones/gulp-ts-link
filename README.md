# gulp-ts-link
Create a single, **module-free** TypeScript or JavaScript file from multiple TS or JS source files that use TS/ES6 modules.  Build a straightforward single file JavaScript library, and still get of the awesome code organization that comes from using TypeScript/ES6 modules during development.  No Webpack weirdness.  Because sometimes, you can have it all.
